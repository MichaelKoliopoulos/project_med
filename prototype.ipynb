      "*   **Increased hunger (polyphagia):** Feeling hungry more often than usual.\n",
      "*   **Unexplained weight loss:** Losing weight without trying.\n",
      "*   **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.\n",
      "*   **Blurred vision:** Difficulty focusing.\n",
      "*   **Slow-healing sores:** Cuts and bruises that take longer to heal.\n",
      "*   **Frequent infections:** Increased susceptibility to infections, such as skin infections, urinary tract infections, and yeast infections.\n",
      "*   **Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy):** This can cause pain, burning, or a pins-and-needles sensation.\n",
      "*   **Darkened areas of skin, usually in the armpits and neck (acanthosis nigricans):** This is a sign of insulin resistance.\n",
